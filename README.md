We create a command line interface wtih Go to compare performance compared to Python and R codes over 100 iterations for the housesinput.csv file. To do this, we add subtle changes to the Python and R code to caculate their respective runtimes. It turns out Python has a runtime of 0.46 seconds, R has a runtime of 2.54 seconds, and Go has a runtime of 0.90 seconds. The first cli.R file and the housesOutputR.txt give the results in the R language. The second cli.go and housesOutputGo.txt do a similar task for the Go language. Lastly, the cli.py and housesOutputPy.txt achieve the task for Python. The original housesInput.csv is the data used for each calculation.
